# computational-mathematics-final-project
This repository contains the final project for my Computational Mathematics course (CSCI B280) at the University of South Carolina Beaufort (USCB). The project includes a technical report summarizing methods for solving Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) with initial value conditions, as covered in Chapter 10 of our course textbook.
